# Gen-AI-Projects


This repository contains a collection of AI-driven applications that I have worked on, each with a unique purpose and implementation. Below are the projects along with their brief descriptions:

## 1. AI News Generation using Crewai
An AI-powered news generation application implemented using Crewai. The project utilizes agents that work sequentially for both **researching** and **writing**. It leverages the Serper API to access the internet and collect information on the specified category. Users can input a category of interest, and the agents will automatically gather relevant news, providing insights or updates for that category.

**Key Technologies:**
- Crewai (agents for researching and writing)
- Serper API (internet access for information gathering)

## 2. Medical Report Analyzer
This project was initially a fun personal task assigned by my father to analyze my grandfather's lab report. I used Google Gemini with a tailored prompt to retrieve the patient details, report ID, date, and analyze the observations listed in the report. The project provides a personalized **diet plan** based on the analysis of the medical report. I aim to make this application more robust and scale it to a larger audience.

**Key Technologies:**
- Google Gemini (for data retrieval and analysis)
- Medical report analysis
- Personalized diet plan generation

## 3. Nutrie-Genie
An LLM (Large Language Model) application that uses Google Gemini to generate a **recipe** based on a given food photo. Additionally, it analyzes the **nutritional contents** present in the food, providing insights into the **health benefits** and **risks** of consuming the food. Users can submit an image of food, and the application will return an analysis of the nutritional value and prepare a corresponding recipe.

**Key Technologies:**
- Google Gemini (for food analysis)
- LLM for recipe generation
- Nutritional content analysis

## 4. Smart HR Agent (LLM-based)
This project was developed as part of a college hackathon in collaboration with my seniors. The **Smart HR Agent** is designed to assist job applicants by providing a chatbot interface to:
- **Learn more about the company** by interacting with the chatbot.
- **Submit resumes** for job applications, with updates sent to the applicant's email.
- **Submit medical certificates** for medical leave applications, with status updates also sent to the email.

Though I primarily worked on the **Streamlit interface**, I gained valuable insights into the working and functioning of LLM application, thanks to the guidance of my team. Our project secured the **second place** in the hackathon!

**Key Technologies:**
- LLM for chatbot integration
- Streamlit for the user interface
- Email notifications for job and leave status updates

## Note : I havenâ€™t uploaded the code yet as I am still testing these projects on various aspects to make them as perfect as possible. I will be uploading the code for these projects soon! Do check them out and give me your valuable feedback when they are uploaded.
